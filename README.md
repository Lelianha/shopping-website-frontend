### Built With

[![React][Reactjs.com]][reactjs-url]

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
it developed a new way of rendering websites, evolving the responsive nature of web pages, also it is mainly used in front-end development.
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”,
the concept in React is React components, and each component can help us reuse our code and better manage our project.

![JavaScript][javascript.com]

Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
it is widely used all over the world for both frontend and backend development (in this project we used it for the frontend).
However, JavaScript supports dynamic typing which means the types of the
variables we create are defined only at runtime based on the stored value, also Javascript is not relying on any platform to execute the code,
which means that once we write our script it can be run anywhere and anytime.

## Usage

In this project, we use javaScript as a programing language and React as a library to create our responsive web page,
the data we saved in the back-end in java classes we pass it by APIs to different components in React,
and by using the HTML elements and CSS styles we displayed the web page in beautiful way.
